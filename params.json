{"name":"Pdf version","tagline":"PDF version of MER content. With study tips for how to use hints, final answers, solutions.","body":"## Welcome to the Math Educational Resources\r\n\r\nThis page hosts pdf versions of the content on the [Math Educational Resources](http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources). At MER we hope that these pdf versions help you for your studies. We also provide a study guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Brush up topics that need work?\r\n\r\n*Avoid the temptation to read any of the hints and final answers below before completing each question by yourself first! We recommend you follow the guide below.*\r\n\r\n+ **You identified topics that need work** Practice makes perfect, working through relevant problems will help you master any topic:\r\n- Re-do related homework and webwork questions.\r\n- The Math Exam Resources offers mini video lectures on each topic.\r\n- Work through previous exam questions using the [original exam](http://www.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/index.shtml).\r\n\r\n+ **How to approach a problem** Make sure you understand the problem fully: What is the question asking you to do? Are there specific conditions or constraints that you should take note of? How will you know if your answer is correct from your work only? Do you expect the answer to be a number, a function, a graph, or something else? Can you rephrase the question in your own words in a way that makes sense to you?\r\n\r\n+ **How to use the hints** In the real exam there won't be hints, so only consult the hints when you exhausted all of your ideas. Solving the question by yourself is invaluable, so please consider each hint for a while. Does it give you a new idea on how to approach the problem? If so, try it!\r\n\r\n+ **How to use the final answer** *The final answer is not a substitution for the full solution!* The final answer alone will not give you full marks. The final answer is provided so that you can check the correctness of your work without spoiling the full solution. If our answer agrees with your work: good job! Otherwise, go back to your work and check it for improvements. Is there another approach you could try? If you can't get to the answer, you can check the full solution on the [Math Educational Resources](http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources).\r\n\r\n+ **Reflect on your work** Generally, reflect on how you solved the problem. Don't just focus on the final answer, but whether your mental process was correct. If you were stuck at any point, what helped you to go forward? What made you confident that your answer was correct? What can you take away from this so that, next time, you can complete a similar question without any help?\r\n\r\n+ **Plan further studying** Once you feel confident enough with a particular topic, move on to topics that need more work. Focus on questions that you find challenging, not on those that are easy for you. Once you are ready to tackle a full exam, follow the advice for the full exam (click here).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
